Traffic Light Control System:-

The Traffic Light Control System project aims to develop an efficient and reliable method for 
managing urban traffic flow using fundamental digital circuitry components. This system leverages
the capabilities of the IC 4017 decade counter and the versatile 555 timer IC to control the
illumination of Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs, simulating a real-world traffic signal operation. 
The 555 timer functions as a clock generator, delivering periodic pulses to the 4017 counter IC,
which sequentially activates the LEDs corresponding to the standard traffic light sequence. The 
duration for which each LED remains lit is dictated by the pulse width of the 555 timer,
adjustable via an integrated potentiometer. This configuration allows for fine-tuning of the signal
timing, ensuring optimal traffic flow management. By utilizing readily available electronic
components, this project demonstrates a practical and scalable approach to traffic control,
emphasizing simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability in various traffic scenarios.
